      //-   Innocence Burned, Alive on the Stage
      //-   Tortured and Dumped in nameless graves
      //-   Centuries weighed, authority died
      //-   Scattering seeds of bleach and lye

      //-   Child molesters and Jesuits

      //-   Somewhere high in the desert near a curtain of a blue
      //-   St. Anne's skirts are billowing
      //-   But down here in the city of the lime lights
      //-   The fans of santa ana are withering
      //-   And you canâ€™t deny that living is easy
      //-   If you never look behind the scenery
      //-   It's showtime for dry climes
      //-   And bedlam is dreaming of rain

      //-   When the hills of los angeles are burning
      //-   Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
      //-   So many lives are on the breeze
      //-   Even the stars are ill at ease
      //-   And los angeles is burning

      //-   This is not a test
      //-   Of the emergency broadcast system
      //-   Where malibu fires and radio towers
      //-   Conspire to dance again
      //-   And I cannot believe the media Mecca
      //-   They're only trying to peddle reality,
      //-   Catch it on prime time, story at nine
      //-   The whole world is going insane

      //-   When the hills of los angeles are burning
      //-   Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
      //-   So many lives are on the breeze
      //-   Even the stars are ill at ease
      //-   And los angeles is burning

      //-   A placard reads
      //-   "the end of days"
      //-   Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze

      //-   More a question than a curse
      //-   How could hell be any worse?

      //-   The flames are stunning
      //-   The cameras running
      //-   So take warning

      //-   When the hills of los angeles are burnin
      //-   Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
      //-   So many lives are on the breeze
      //-   Even the stars are ill at ease
      //-   And los angeles is burning
