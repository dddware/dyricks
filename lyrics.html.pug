        Innocence Burned, Alive on the Stage
        Tortured and Dumped in nameless graves
        Centuries weighed, authority died
        Scattering seeds of bleach and lye

        Coming back for more to even the score
        Sinister Rouge
        Coming back for more to even the score

        Child molesters and Jesuits
        Holding secret conference
        Underneath the pontiff's nose
        And only god will ever know

        Sinister Rouge
        Coming back for more to even the score
        Sinister Rouge
        Coming back for more to even the score

        Give us this day our daily bread
        And then you'll see we'll not forget
        Lick the wounds, cleanse the land
        The modern world rejects your hands

        Sinister Rouge
        Coming back for more to even the score

        Somewhere high in the desert near a curtain of a blue
        St. Anne's skirts are billowing
        But down here in the city of the lime lights
        The fans of santa ana are withering
        And you canâ€™t deny that living is easy
        If you never look behind the scenery
        It's showtime for dry climes
        And bedlam is dreaming of rain

        When the hills of los angeles are burning
        Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
        So many lives are on the breeze
        Even the stars are ill at ease
        And los angeles is burning

        This is not a test
        Of the emergency broadcast system
        Where malibu fires and radio towers
        Conspire to dance again
        And I cannot believe the media Mecca
        They're only trying to peddle reality,
        Catch it on prime time, story at nine
        The whole world is going insane

        When the hills of los angeles are burning
        Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
        So many lives are on the breeze
        Even the stars are ill at ease
        And los angeles is burning

        A placard reads
        "the end of days"
        Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze

        More a question than a curse
        How could hell be any worse?

        The flames are stunning
        The cameras running
        So take warning

        When the hills of los angeles are burnin
        Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
        So many lives are on the breeze
        Even the stars are ill at ease
        And los angeles is burning
